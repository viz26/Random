# üí´ About Me:
üëã Hey there, I'm Vidit, a passionate Computer Science student at Silver Oak University. My journey in the world of tech has been an exciting one, and I'm eager to share a bit about myself with you.

üéì Currently, I'm immersed in my studies, where I'm diving deep into subjects like python, sql, Networking, and Cybersecurity. Pursuing my degree in Computer Science has provided me with a strong foundation in these areas.

üîê Cybersecurity has always intrigued me, and I'm proud to have knowledge in this field, along with a Microsoft certification (SC-900) under my belt. I'm also well-versed in cloud computing, Python, Linux, bash, VM, and vNET.

üåê Beyond the classroom, I've explored the exciting world of cloud computing and even earned certifications. Plus, I hold a certification from Google in Generative AI, where I've delved into the fascinating realm of artificial intelligence.

üöÄ As I continue to grow and learn, I'm eager to connect with like-minded individuals, industry professionals, and potential collaborators. Let's connect, share insights, and explore the ever-evolving world of technology together.
